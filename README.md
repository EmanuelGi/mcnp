# complex-network
A Project of Complex Network

这是一个复杂网络建模的Project, 该项目主要针对老师对班级学生的一些信息得到一个数据表，该表记录了学生与学生之间的一些关系，这个关系可以通过网络建模，建模后，我们可以发现一些规律，具体的要求如下：

We have done an investigation on the connections in our class, and three corresponding social
networks under different conditions (i.e., knowing someone’s name, knowing someone’s hometown,
and knowing someone’s dialect) are formulated. Please download the data from our assigned FTP.

(1) Perform some computer simulations (by using whatever computer software or programming language)
on the three graphs to analyze the network properties (such as node-degree distribution, average shortest
path-length, clustering coefficient, etc.) and dynamical behaviors (such as robustness against intentional
attack and random attack, etc.).

(2) Calculate the node coreness in the three graphs;

(3) Draw necessary figures and/or tables to demonstrate your simulation results and to support your
observations;

(4) To have extra bonus, you can develop a small system (including friendly interfaces, or graphic
demonstrations) to show the layout of the networks of our class.

本项目采用Java开发，画图采用的是JDK自带的工具包，具体细节可参考源码，一些截图如下：
