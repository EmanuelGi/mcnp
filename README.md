[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/RedSparr0w/node-csgo-parser.svg)]() [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Java-green.svg)]()
## Description

We have done an investigation on the connections in our class, and three corresponding social networks under different conditions (i.e., knowing someone’s name, knowing someone’s hometown,

and knowing someone’s dialect) are formulated. Please download the data from our assigned FTP.

(1) Perform some computer simulations (by using whatever computer software or programming language)
on the three graphs to analyze the network properties (such as node-degree distribution, average shortest
path-length, clustering coefficient, etc.) and dynamical behaviors (such as robustness against intentional
attack and random attack, etc.).

(2) Calculate the node coreness in the three graphs;

(3) Draw necessary figures and/or tables to demonstrate your simulation results and to support your
observations;

(4) To have extra bonus, you can develop a small system (including friendly interfaces, or graphic
demonstrations) to show the layout of the networks of our class.
